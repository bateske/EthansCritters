// SdSpi.cpp - see SdSpi.h. From HypeRunner's src/sd/SdSpi.cpp (MIT, clean
// room: written from the SD Physical Layer Simplified Specification, chapter
// 7, and the CH32X035 reference manual), reduced to polled single-block
// reads. The simulator's stand-in is tools/chsim/host/sd_host.cpp.
//
// Speed: a block is about 0.5 ms of polled bytes at 12 MHz, and the card's
// own access time (CMD17 to the data token, 0.1-1 ms and more) is on top of
// that, so for read() a faster clock or DMA would save little. stream() is
// for the sketch that reads a whole file every frame (CHStlView): one
// command for a run of blocks, 24 MHz and DMA, the block before worked on
// while the next arrives. The games never call it, so the linker leaves it
// out of their images.
//
// Size notes (-Os, RV32, LTO): loop counters are word-sized (uint8_t ones
// cost a mask on every pass). The two extra flags below took 0-28 B off the
// games' images on 2026-10-01; on Fat.cpp they cost up to 88 B, so it keeps
// plain -Os (measure all three games before changing either).
