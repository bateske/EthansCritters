# CHSd

Read-only microSD access for CHGame games: a polled SPI-mode block driver
and a FAT16/FAT32 reader that turns a file name into runs of card blocks.
It is about 1.7 KB of flash and 24 B of RAM (plus the caller's run list),
and it shares SPI1 with CHGfx's panel.

It is the one SD library of the games that read text off the card:

| Game | File on the card | What it uses |
|---|---|---|
| CHWords | `WORDS.DIC` in the root (the full ENABLE word list) | `fat::open`, `fat::read` |
| CHWordWheel | `PHRASES.BNK` in the root (the phrase bank) | `fat::open`, `fat::read` |
| CHCrossword | `CHCW/*.CWD` (puzzle packs) | `mount`, `folder`, `match`, `runs`, `fat::read` |
| CHStlView (an app) | any `.STL` in any folder, read whole every frame | `mount`, `root`, `list`, `runs`, `sd::stream` |

## How a game uses it

    // Once, after gfx_wait() (the card shares SPI1 with the panel):
    fat::Run run[4];
    uint8_t nRuns = fat::open("WORDS   DIC", run, 4, gfx_chunkScratch());
    // ... then any block of the file, any time after gfx_wait():
    if (!fat::read(run, nRuns, k, gfx_chunkScratch())) { /* the card has gone */ }

- **Bus rule.** Call it only between `gfx_wait()` and the next flush. SPI1
  is handed back as CHGfx left it.
- **Buffer.** Every call borrows a 512 B, 4-byte-aligned buffer and
  clobbers it. CHGfx's chunk scratch is idle between `gfx_wait()` and the
  flush, so all three games use that.
- **After a failed read,** drop the card and call `sd::init()` (or
  `fat::open`) again before the next read. A late block can still be on its
  way, and only a reset clears it.
- **Names** are 8.3 short names as the directory stores them: 11 capitals,
  padded with spaces. `?` matches any character. Long names, volume labels,
  hidden entries and deleted entries are skipped.
- **Players' cards** must be FAT16 or FAT32, which is how cards up to 32 GB
  come. exFAT (64 GB and up) is reported as `E_EXFAT` so a game can say
  "reformat as FAT32". A file in more pieces than the game's run list is
  refused (`E_FRAG`). Copying it to a freshly formatted card always works.

**Browsing and streaming** (2026-10-02, for CHStlView): `fat::root()` and
`fat::list()` walk any folder, files and folders alike, through a
callback; `sd::stream()` reads a run of blocks with one CMD18 at 24 MHz,
each block landing by DMA (channels 2 and 3, borrowed between flushes)
while the caller's function works on the one before: about 0.17 ms a block
instead of ~1.5 ms. The games call neither, so their images are byte for
byte what they were.

**Streaming a game's card file** (2026-10-03, for Ethan's Critters, which
streams its world and sprites every frame): `fat::stream()` streams any
range of a file's blocks through its runs (one `sd::stream()` per run it
touches; its own file, `src/FatStream.cpp`), `sd::setStreamTimeout()` lets
a per-frame reader give up after a few ms instead of 1 s, and
`sd::recover()` gets the card going again after a failed stream without
`init()` (see `src/SdSpi.h` for why that is safe after a stream and not
after `read()`). The games call none of these; their images are unchanged.

The full API is in [src/Fat.h](src/Fat.h) and [src/SdSpi.h](src/SdSpi.h).

## Using it

CHSd is bundled in the CHGame board package's `libraries/` folder, so a
sketch only needs `#include <Fat.h>` (and `<SdSpi.h>` for raw blocks). In
this repository `tools/device.py` passes the folder with `--library`.
CHWords, CHCrossword and CHWordWheel use it this way; they used to carry
generated copies, which are gone.

In the simulator (`tools/chsim/chsim.py`) a sketch that includes CHSd is
built with `src/Fat.cpp` as it is and `host/sd_host.cpp` in place of the
SPI driver: the file named by `$CHSD_CARD` is the card (a `*.img` as a
whole card, any other file on a FAT16 card made for it by `host/VCard.h`).

To change the library, edit it here, then run (from this folder):

    python tests/run_tests.py

Then run `chgame check` in each of the three games, which also checks that
both save pages still fit.

## Testing

- `tests/run_tests.py` runs `src/Fat.cpp` on the PC against FAT16 and FAT32
  images built by `tools/fatimg.py`, whose layout is the ground truth. The
  images cover:
  - with and without a partition table, and the partition in slot 3;
  - 2 KB and 4 KB clusters, one FAT or two;
  - long names and decoy entries;
  - files and the FAT32 root directory in pieces;
  - a hidden file, a same-named file in another folder, and empty and
    one-byte files;
  - looped, cut-short and over-long FAT chains;
  - exFAT, a blank card, and a FAT12-sized volume.

  It also pulls the card after every possible number of reads. `--quick`
  leaves out the 34 MB FAT32 images.
- The simulators' card (`host/sd_host.cpp`) serves a `.img` file as the
  whole card. Any other file (`sdcard/WORDS.DIC`, `sdcard/PHRASES.BNK`) goes onto a
  pretend FAT16 card built on the fly (`host/VCard.h`), in two pieces with a
  gap between them. So every simulator session runs the real FAT code,
  including a step from one run to the next.
- The simulator's card checks the bus rule (any `sd::` call while a flush
  still holds SPI1 is a `BUG:` line) and takes its timing from the
  environment, so a sketch can be tried against a slow, jittery, cold or
  failing card: `CHSD_SIM_CMD_US` (600), `CHSD_SIM_BLK_US` (170),
  `CHSD_SIM_READ_US` (900), `CHSD_SIM_JITTER_US` (0), `CHSD_SIM_COLD_US`
  (0) per `CHSD_SIM_COLD_KB` (1024) region, `CHSD_SIM_FAIL_EVERY` (0),
  `CHSD_SIM_INIT_US` (0); the comment at the top of `host/sd_host.cpp` has
  the details. The defaults are the timing it always had.
- **Not yet run on a board.** None of the three games has read a real card
  yet. The first device session should check: a FAT32 SDHC card, a small
  FAT16 card, an exFAT card (the message), pulling the card mid-game, and
  how long `fat::open` and one `fat::read` take.

## Review of the three copies (2026-10-01)

**Before.** CHWords cut HypeRunner's driver down to polled, read-only
single-block reads. CHWordWheel took that cut unchanged; its `src/sd` was
byte-identical to CHWords'. CHCrossword took a snapshot of it and went its
own way:

| | CHWords / CHWordWheel | CHCrossword |
|---|---|---|
| Token timeout | 300 ms | **1 s**: some cards take 300-770 ms for a block's first read after power-up |
| FAT lookups | root directory only | **folder + `?` patterns + skip**, hidden files filtered (macOS `._` files would otherwise match `*.CWD`) |
| `Fat.cpp` on the PC | compiled out; the sim passed the raw file as the card, so the FAT code **never ran off the board** | compiled in, host-tested on FAT16/FAT32 images |
| Extent to LBA mapping | its own loop in each game | its own loop |

**Merged into CHSd:**

- CHCrossword's lookup is used in all three, and its 1 s timeout too.
- The run-mapping loop the three games each had is now `fat::read`. The
  init + mount + find + runs sequence two of them repeated is now
  `fat::open`.
- The simulators of CHWords and CHWordWheel, and CHWordWheel's bank tests,
  now go through the FAT code (VCard). The library has its own test suite,
  which all three share.

**Smaller, measured on the release images (oslto, Upload only):**

| Game | Before | After | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| CHWords | 50,416 B | 50,396 B | −20 B |
| CHCrossword | 50,400 B | 50,300 B | −100 B |
| CHWordWheel | 50,408 B | 50,312 B | −96 B |

Static RAM is unchanged in all three. Where the bytes came from:

- **Word-sized loop counters.** A `uint8_t` counter costs a mask on every
  pass.
- **One timeout constant for both waits.** With 300 ms for both, GCC had
  folded it into `wait()`. Raising only the token wait to 1 s cost 16 B, so
  both waits now use 1 s. A read-only driver never leaves the card busy, so
  the longer busy wait costs nothing in practice.
- **One attribute test instead of two.** Hidden files, labels, long-name
  parts and file-versus-folder are all rejected by one masked compare,
  which costs nothing over the old label check.
- **`fat::open` returns only a run count.** Passing the error code through
  cost about 40 B in the games that never show it.
- **Extra flags on `SdSpi.cpp` only.** `no-jump-tables` and
  `no-guess-branch-probability` save up to 28 B there, but cost up to 88 B
  on `Fat.cpp`.

**Considered and not done:**

- **A faster clock (24 MHz), pipelined SPI or DMA for `read()`.** (A
  streaming reader that does all three, for a sketch that reads whole files
  every frame, is `sd::stream()`, which the games do not use.) A block is about
  0.5 ms of polled bytes, and the card's own access time (0.1-1 ms or more)
  comes on top, so these would save under 0.3 ms per block. Nobody would
  notice that in these games. There is also no CRC on the wire to catch a
  marginal 24 MHz signal. A pipelined loop overruns if an interrupt lands
  mid-block. DMA would need CHGfx's channel 3. HypeRunner, which streams,
  does all of this with CRCs and a step-down; word games do not need it.
- **A block cache.** It would need its own 512 B of RAM, since the chunk
  scratch is redrawn every frame. CHCrossword has under 1 KB of RAM left,
  and no game reads the same block twice in a frame.
- **CMD12 after a late token.** It costs about 16 B. Every game already
  drops the card on a failed read and re-initialises it (CMD0) before
  reading again, so the late block can never be taken for an answer.
